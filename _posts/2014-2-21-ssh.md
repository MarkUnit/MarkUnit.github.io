1.structs 2.3.16 is new version of the strusts 2

2.Apache Struts is a free, open-source, MVC framework for creating elegant, modern Java web applications. It favors convention over configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with plugins to support REST, AJAX and JSON.

3. REST:Representational State Transfer

4. AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
	AJAX is not a new programming language, but a new way to use existing standards.
	AJAX is the art of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page - without reloading the whole page.

5.JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
